# Craps_Simulator
Craps Simulator repository on GitHub (Hoo wee! My first project!!)

This is an exercise to learn about GitHub/GitHub projects and Python 3.7.n

Project goals:
1. Create a Python based "Craps" game implementing "Vegas" Rules
2. Allow a specific extension to the rules that I call "Texas" Craps
   a. Limited number of rolls.
   b. Both "7" and "2" are loosing rolls.
3. Create the game and make it modular.
   a. Initial implementation will use Python functions as modules.
   b. Subsequent implementations will use Python classes and inheritance.
4.  Allow command-line parameters to modify characteristics of the game
   a. Number of rolls. (0 / blank = unlimited)
   b. "Texas" variant.
   c. "Craps tutorial" for those unfamiliar with the game.
4. Become familiar/proficient with GitHub in particular and version management in general

Stretch Goals:
1.  Classes and inheritance instead of functions.
    (Will probably require complete re-factoring of the code.)
    (Might want to make a fork of the Master branch for this?)
2.  Implement game as a stand-aline runtime executable.
3.  Implement a graphical version of the game.
    (This will be a "stretch" with a capital "STRETCH"
    !)
